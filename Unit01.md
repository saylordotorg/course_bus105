**Unit 1: Cost Measurement And Estimation** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit will begin by examining the differences between financial and
managerial accounting.  The primary difference, as you will learn, is
the audience for the financial and managerial accounting information. 
Financial accounting information is geared toward external users, and
managerial accounting information is geared toward internal users. 
Managerial accounting is integral to making operational and strategic
decisions.  At the end of this unit, you will be able to explain why
there is a need for both financial and managerial accounting.*  
  
 *This unit will also introduce you to the manufacturing process and
related financial accounting transactions.  You will differentiate
between costs assigned to products and costs assigned to the period. 
One key item to notice is that the flow of costs in accounting mirrors
the physical flow of the inventory.  For example, a pizza parlor
purchases pepperoni, sausage, and olives (direct materials) to go on the
pizzas.  When a customer orders a pizza, the direct materials are
assembled and baked (work in process), and a completed pizza (finished
goods) is delivered to the customer.*

**Unit 1 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 5 hours to complete.

**1.1.2 Managerial Decision Making** <span id="1.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 1.1 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 18.2.  As you are reading,
evaluate what types of managerial accounting information you use or
produce in your job.  Does it surprise you to realize that you are
already familiar with some parts of managerial accounting?*  
    
 The subtopics below will discuss how managerial accounting contributes
to the planning and controlling functions.  (The four functions of
management—planning, organizing, leading, and controlling—are covered in
[BUS208: Principles of
Management](http://www.saylor.org/courses/bus208/).)

**1.2.1 The Manufacturing Process** <span id="1.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 1.2 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 18.5.  As you read, think about
Dell Corporation and how the company would account for a computer.*

**1.2.2 Period Costs vs. Product Costs** <span id="1.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 1.2 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 18.4.  Product costs are all costs
that can be attributed to a product.  For example, direct materials,
direct labor, indirect materials, and indirect labor are product costs. 
All other costs are period costs.  The easiest way to translate this to
financial accounting is to remember that period costs are operating
expenses.*

**1.2.3 Direct Materials** <span id="1.2.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 1.2 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 18.4.  Go back to the example of
Dell Corporation.  What are some of the direct materials for Dell?  Keys
on a keyboard, computer screens, computer chips.  Those are all
materials that are in the actual product a customer receives.  Think
about a tennis shoe manufacturer.  What would direct materials be for
that company?*

**1.2.4 Direct Labor** <span id="1.2.4"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 1.2 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 18.4.  A good way to determine if
someone should be included in direct labor is to consider if that
person’s primary job function is to work on the actual product.  If my
job were to assemble computers at Dell, my payroll costs would be
allocated to direct labor.  If my job were to oversee the person
assembling computers, my payroll costs would be allocated to indirect
labor and, thus, manufacturing overhead.  (For more on manufacturing
overhead, see subsection 1.2.5 below.)*

**1.2.5 Manufacturing Overhead** <span id="1.2.5"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 1.2 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 18.4.  Recall the definition of a
product cost from section 1.2.2.  Manufacturing overhead is any product
cost that is not direct materials or direct labor.  Thus, manufacturing
overhead is all of the costs required for the production process that
are not directly related to the product.  Consider the following items:
factory utilities, administration building utilities, showroom
utilities, factory depreciation, administration computer depreciation. 
Which items would be considered manufacturing overhead and which items
would be period costs?  Hint: If it pertains to the factory, it is
likely manufacturing overhead.*

*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 1.2 and is
identified in the textbook as Sections 18.5 and 18.6.  As you are
reading, notice how the accounting process reflects the physical flow of
inventory.  This is illustrated on page 553.*
