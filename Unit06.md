**Unit 6: Performance Evaluation** <span id="6"></span> 
*This unit will explore ways in which managerial accounting helps
companies evaluate performance of the company, segments, departments,
and individuals.  Responsibility accounting assumes that every cost
incurred by a company is the responsibility of someone.  Thus, companies
that utilize responsibility accounting connect compensation to financial
performance.  Operations managers are not only evaluated by their
ability to manage costs, but also by the quality and efficiency of the
production process they oversee.*  
  
 *Two common methods that companies employ to evaluate performance are
just-in-time inventory management and the balanced scorecard. 
Just-in-time inventory management is most common with repetitive
manufacturing processes where the same products are produced on a
regular basis.  The balanced scorecard is a performance management tool
that assists a company in evaluating strategic objectives.  The balanced
scorecard allows companies to evaluate both financial and non-financial
measurements.*
