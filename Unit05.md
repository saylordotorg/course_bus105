**Unit 5: Capital Budgeting** <span id="5"></span> 
*The previous unit focused on budgeting for the day-to-day operations of
a business.  We will now focus on budgeting for long-term investments in
capital projects, such as machinery.  The capital budgeting processes is
usually performed simultaneously when preparing the master budget.  A
company uses capital budgeting to evaluate long-term investments.  For
example, should the company replace a machine now or wait another three
years?*  
  
 *We use several different methods to evaluate the results of capital
budgeting.  Project selection or rejection criteria are based on the
time value of money and discounted cash flows.  Thus, this unit will
briefly introduce you to the time value of money.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 21 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Scroll down and read Section 13.2. The payback period
    is a quick and easy way for a manager to determine when they will
    get the cash back from an investment. After reading, do the
    exercises at the end of the section to assure your understanding.

    is the most important tool in capital budgeting decision making. It
    projects the financial value of the project for the company. After
    reading, do the exercises at the end of the section to assure your
    understanding.  
        
     Reading this section, taking notes, and working through the

    return, or IRR, is another method of capital budgeting. It shows the
    return we will receive on the asset over its life. Although the
    method has its shortfalls, it can still give insight into the value
    of a project and is widely used. After reading, do the exercises at
    the end of the section to assure your understanding.  
        
     Reading this section, taking notes, and working through the

     Instructions: Scroll down and read Section 13.5. Pay particular
    attention to the discussion of profitability index (PI): present
    value return per dollar of investment. PI shows the relative
    profitability of any project: in essence, it's a “bang for your
    buck” calculation. After reading, do the exercises at the end of the
    section to assure your understanding. Then, read the remainder of
    the chapter, which discusses unequal asset lives and risk.

**5.1.2 Cash Flows** <span id="5.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 5.1 and is
identified in the textbook as Sections 26.2 and 26.3.  When performing
capital budgeting, it is important to translate traditional operating
results on the accrual basis to the cash basis.  Two items people
commonly forget to consider are depreciation and taxes, covered in
subunit 5.1.2.*

**5.1.3 Depreciation and Taxes** <span id="5.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 5.1 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 26.3.  It is important to remember
that depreciation is a non-cash expense, and it is a tax-deductible
expense.  Thus, while it may seem redundant to subtract deprecation to
calculate tax expense, and to add depreciation to arrive at cash flows,
it does serve an important purpose.*
