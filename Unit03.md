**Unit 3: Short-Term Decision Making** <span id="3"></span> 
*This unit will introduce a new way to evaluate costs.  Rather than
examining direct materials, direct labor, and manufacturing overhead,
this information is rearranged into variable costs, fixed costs, and
mixed costs.  For example, a factory worker who earns a salary and an
annual bonus based on company performance was classified as direct labor
in the previous unit.  In this unit, salary is allocated to fixed costs
and the bonus to variable costs.*  
  
 *Understanding how costs behave means you will be able to make
predictions about revenue and operating income, given certain changes in
sales volume.  You will also be able to determine how many units a
company needs to sell to break even.  If a company cannot break even, it
should reconsider its business model.*  
  
 *This unit also introduces differential analysis.  Differential
analysis will enable you to make specific strategic decisions for a
company.  For example, should a company accept a special order?  Should
a company make a component for its product or purchase it
prefabricated?*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 14.75 hours to complete.

Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Describe cost behavior when sales volume increases.
-   Separate a mixed cost into its fixed and variable components by
    using the high-low method, and discuss the drawbacks and benefits of
    the high-low method.

    well as discuss cost-volume-profit analysis.
-   Describe and calculate the break-even point.
-   Calculate the margin of safety. Explain what the margin of safety
    means to a company.
-   Identify components of a contribution margin income statement and a
    financial income statement as well as describe the similarities and
    differences between a contribution margin income statement and a
    financial income statement.
-   Explain how to apply differential analysis as well as use
    differential analysis to make strategic business decisions.

**3.1.1 Variable Costs** <span id="3.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 3.1 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 21.3.  The key to understanding
costs is to remember that we are thinking about how costs behave
relative to production in sales.  So, variable costs will fluctuate
based on how much product is sold.*

**3.1.2 Fixed Costs** <span id="3.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 3.1 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 21.3.  Fixed costs are going to be
incurred whether no units are sold or a billion units are sold.  After
you have completed this section, take the assessment under subsection
3.1.3 to test your understanding.*

**3.1.3 Mixed Costs** <span id="3.1.3"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 3.1 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 21.3.  Mixed costs have both a
fixed and a variable component.  You can think of your cell phone bill
as a mixed cost.  You pay a flat fee for a certain number of minutes. 
If you exceed the set amount of minutes, then you have to pay by the
minute.  Can you think of other examples of mixed costs?*

**3.2.1 Revenue** <span id="3.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 3.2 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 21.5.  In Illustration 21.7 in the
text (page 99), notice that the Sales line is constant. 
Cost-volume-profit analysis assumes that the selling price per unit is
the same throughout the relevant range.*

**3.2.2 Operating Income** <span id="3.2.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 3.2 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 21.5.  Cost-volume-profit analysis
introduces the contribution margin income statement.  Ultimately,
operating income is the same on the traditional income statement and the
contribution income statement.  The difference is that cost of goods
sold and operating expenses are allocated between variable expenses and
fixed expenses on the contribution margin income statement.*

key term in cost-volume-profit analysis.  Be sure that you understand
the term and can calculate contribution margin.*

**3.2.6 Assumptions of Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis** <span
id="3.2.6"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 3.2 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 21.8.  Just like any other
analysis tool, you must keep in mind that cost-volume-profit analysis
makes certain assumptions that may not hold true in a real business
environment.  Thus, it is important to understand that
cost-volume-profit analysis must be taken into consideration with other
models as well.  In particular, companies use cost-volume-profit
analysis with budgeting, which we will cover in Unit 4.*

**3.3.1 Introduction** <span id="3.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 3.3 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 22.3.  With respect to
differential analysis, we need to focus on relevant costs.  For example,
suppose you were going on vacation.  You live in Chicago and you are
going to San Francisco.  You can either fly or drive.  Regardless of
which method of travel you choose, you only have fourteen days of
vacation.  What factors would be relevant to your decision?  Hint: There
are both tangible and intangible factors to consider.*

     Instructions: Read this section. Managers often use differential
    analysis to determine whether to keep or drop a product line. Direct
    fixed costs are typically eliminated if a product line is eliminated
    and are considered differential costs. Allocated fixed costs are
