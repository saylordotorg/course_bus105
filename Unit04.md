**Unit 4: Budgeting And Cost Variances** <span id="4"></span> 
*The budget process is essential to planning and controlling cycles.  It
provides a plan for operations and a benchmark by which to measure
progress.  The budget process involves coordination among all the
departments in a company.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn about the components of the master budget
and prepare all of the underlying schedules.  Once the master budget is
complete, the company can measure actual performance against the
budget.  Throughout the year, a company will create a flexible budget to
understand why there are variances from the original master budget.  It
is important to understand that the budgeting process is a continuous
cycle.  While the original master budget is static, a company will use
actual results to adjust operations and expectations.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 27.25 hours to complete.
