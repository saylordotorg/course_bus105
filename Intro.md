Course Syllabus for "BUS105: Managerial Accounting"
---------------------------------------------------

In [BUS103](/courses/bus103/) (Financial Accounting), we learned that
firms need to track various forms of data in order to report to
investors, regulators, and potential business associates such as
customers and vendors.  Firm managers, however, often need information
that is much more detailed than the data provided in these financial
reports.  They use what is known as “managerial accounting” to make
various decisions about their businesses.  To avoid information
overload, much of their data is tailored to the needs of a particular
business unit instead of generally applicable to the firm as a whole. As
you might expect, different managers have different needs.  However,
almost all management decisions deal with the same key issues: cost,
price, and profit.  This course will examine this sort of
decision-making, identifying the tools and methods managers use to make
the best-informed decisions possible.  We will begin with an
introduction to the terms that will be referenced in the later units. 
We will then discuss the various methods and theories that managers
deploy when tracking costs and profits.  The final section will explain
how managers report the overall performance of a firm or department for
internal use.  Upon completion of this course, students will be better
prepared to make informed decisions within a firm.
