**Unit 2: Cost Management** <span id="2"></span> 
*In the previous unit, you learned about the flow of manufacturing
costs.  This unit focuses on the allocation of direct materials, direct
labor, and manufacturing overhead.  For a company that produces items
for jobs, it is easy to identify the direct materials and direct labor
for a specific job.  However, how do you determine direct materials if
the company uses a continuous assembly line?  It would be inefficient to
track each unit of production separately.  This unit also addresses how
to allocate manufacturing overhead.  Manufacturing overhead consists of
costs not directly related to the product but necessary to run the
production process.  This includes, but is not limited to, factory
equipment, factory rent, and utilities for the factory.*

**Unit 2 Time Advisory**  
This unit should take you approximately 12.25 hours to complete.

     Instructions: Read sections 18.7 to 18.13 on pages 555 to 577. 
    Note that this reading covers the topics outlined in subunits 2.1.1

    hours.  
        
     Remember to work through the Demonstration Problems and Self-Test
    at the end of this chapter.  The Demonstration Problems and

**2.1.1 Direct Materials and Direct Labor** <span id="2.1.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 2.1 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 18.7.  Job costing is primarily
used with customized products or when separate products are identified. 
For example, Boeing likely uses job costing when producing airplanes. 
Direct materials and direct labor are allocated to specific jobs, based
on what is actually incurred.*

**2.1.2 Actual and Applied Overhead** <span id="2.1.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 2.1 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 18.8.  Overhead is more difficult
to allocate in terms of specific jobs.  Because overhead is an
accumulation of all the indirect product costs, the total amount of
actual overhead is usually not known.  Thus, companies use an applied
overhead rate, based on budgeted amounts, to allocate overhead to a
specific job.  At the end of the reporting period, any difference
between actual overhead and allocated overhead is reconciled to cost of
goods sold.*

    Costing Used to Track Production Costs?”**

     Instructions: Read this chapter. Jjob order costing is often used
    for custom jobs, and the total cost of the job is the cost of the
    unit. When multiple units are custom made for the job order, unit
    cost is the total cost of the job order divided by the number of
    units produced.

**2.2.1 Process Costing vs. Job Costing** <span id="2.2.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 2.2 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 19.2.  Whereas job costing focused
on specific batches of production, process costing is best used in an
assembly-line production environment.  The text has an excellent
comparison of the similarities and differences between process costing
and job costing.*

**2.3.1 Why Use Activity Based Costing?** <span id="2.3.1"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 2.3 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 20.7.  Activity-based costing
(ABC) is another method that can be used to allocate overhead.  ABC
allocates overhead based on the activities that are driving the costs. 
Note that  job costing, process costing, and ABC use the same pool of
costs.  They are just three different ways of analyzing and allocating
the pool.*

**2.3.2 Four Steps in Activity-Based Costing** <span id="2.3.2"></span> 
*Note: This topic is covered by the reading in subunit 2.3 and is
identified in the textbook as Section 20.8.  The four steps to apply ABC
are relatively straightforward.  The key is to determine the appropriate
cost driver for each activity.*

     Instructions: Watch the video.  How do you think that ABC could
    result in more accurate costing information?  Do you think it would
    be appropriate to always apply ABC?  Why or why not?  Hint: Consider
    the cost of implementing ABC.  This lecture should take you
    approximately five minutes.
